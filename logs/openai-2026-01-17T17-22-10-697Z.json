Age\n2. Total movies\n3. First movie\n4. Net worth\n5. Spouse\n\nRules for values:\n- Use appropriate format for each metric (e.g., age: \"52 years\", height: \"5'9\\\"\", net_worth: \"$300M\")\n- Keep values concise and readable\n- Use \"Not Married\" or \"N/A\" for missing spouse information\n\nCaption rules:\n- Write a HIGH-ENGAGEMENT, \"Viral Gold\" style caption (150-300 words).\n- Use a \"Pick your King/Queen\" or \"Who wins?\" angle to trigger debates.\n- Use plenty of emojis to stop the scroll 🔥👑.\n- Highlight what makes each celebrity unique and compare their achievements.\n- End with a controversial question to trigger comments (e.g., \"Tell us in the comments who you're backing!\").\n- Make it shareable and addictive for social media fans.\n- NO hashtags in caption (hashtags added separately)\n\nImage rules:\n- DO NOT generate images using AI\n- DO NOT provide Wikipedia URLs (they often return 404 errors)\n- DO NOT provide Google search URLs (e.g., google.com/search?q=...)\n- Instead, provide WORKING, VERIFIED image URLs from reliable sources:\n  * Use image hosting sites like: imgur.com, i.imgur.com, cdn.*, static.*\n  * Use sports/news sites that host images directly (e.g., cricbuzz.com, espncricinfo.com)\n  * URLs must end with image extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp\n  * URLs must be DIRECT links to images (not pages containing images)\n- If you cannot find working image URLs, leave image_url_a and image_url_b EMPTY and provide search queries instead\n- CRITICAL: Both images must be CONSISTENT in style and framing:\n  * Both should be the same type: either BOTH headshots/portraits OR BOTH full-body OR BOTH action shots\n  * Both should be in similar settings (e.g., both on cricket field, both in studio, both in formal attire)\n  * Both should have similar lighting and background style\n  * This ensures a professional, balanced comparison image\n- When creating search queries, specify the image type clearly:\n  * Example: \"Sachin Tendulkar headshot portrait cricket field\" (not just \"Sachin Tendulkar image\")\n  * Example: \"Virat Kohli headshot portrait cricket field\" (same style for consistency)\n  * Use terms like: \"headshot\", \"portrait\", \"professional photo\", \"cricket field\", \"studio photo\", etc.\n- Images should be professional portraits, side-by-side compatible\n- Portrait orientation, clean backgrounds preferred\n- High quality, professional photos\n- ALWAYS provide search queries as backup (image_search_query_a and image_search_query_b)\n\nSTRICT OUTPUT FORMAT (VALID JSON ONLY):\n\n{\n  \"celebrityA\": {\n    \"name\": \"Name in target language\",\n    \"englishName\": \"Full Name STRICTLY in English/Latin script.
