His economy in bowling complements his batting prowess, where he can provide a late-order surge.

Krunal’s bowling adds a strategic edge, and his fielding skills are an asset to any team. His average of 24.27 signifies his impact as a middle-order batsman who can stabilize and accelerate the innings as needed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Deepak Chahar shines with the new ball and delivers crucial wickets, Krunal Pandya’s versatility in batting and effective spin bowling make him a significant asset in the middle overs.
